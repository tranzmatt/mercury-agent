## 1.1.12 — Daemon fix for standalone binaries

Hotfix on top of 1.1.11. The standalone single-file binaries shipped in 1.1.11 could not start in the background — which also meant Telegram never came online when Mercury was installed via the one-line installer (the recommended path for servers).

### Fixed

- **Daemon now starts correctly from standalone binaries** — `src/cli/daemon.ts` used to spawn the daemon as `[process.execPath, process.argv[1], 'start', '--daemon']`. For npm installs that became `node dist/index.js start --daemon` and worked. For `bun --compile` standalone binaries, `process.execPath` is the Mercury binary itself and `process.argv[1]` is a bun-virtual `$bunfs/...` path, so the spawn became `mercury "$bunfs/..." start --daemon` — Commander treated the bunfs path as an unknown subcommand, the child died immediately, and `channels.startAll()` (the only place Telegram is started in daemon mode) was never reached.
- **`mercury service install` no longer persists broken commands** — the LaunchAgent plist, systemd unit, and Windows Task Scheduler entry now contain the binary-only invocation (no script path) when running from a standalone binary, so auto-start on boot works end-to-end.
- **Telegram now comes online in background mode for standalone-binary users** — direct consequence of the daemon fix.

### Internal

- New `isStandaloneBinary()` / `buildDaemonSpawnArgs()` helpers in `src/cli/daemon.ts` plus `getServiceLaunchArgs()` in `src/cli/service.ts`, wired through every OS installer. Detection uses `process.versions.bun`, `$bunfs` / `~BUN` markers in `argv[1]`, and the `execPath` basename — so `node`, `bun <script>`, and standalone `mercury` invocations all do the right thing.

### Migration from 1.1.11

No changes required. After upgrading, run `mercury restart` (or `mercury service uninstall && mercury service install` if you had the service installed under 1.1.11 with the broken command persisted).

## 1.1.11 — Token Saver Mode, Skills System & Standalone Binaries

The biggest release since the 1.1.x line started. Adds a full **Skill System**, a **Token Saver Mode** for cheaper sessions, **standalone binaries** for users who don't want npm, and a redesigned bottom status bar with per-step spinners.

### New

- **Token Saver Mode + bottom status bar overhaul + per-step spinners** (#69) — opt-in mode that aggressively trims context, plus a new persistent status bar at the bottom of the TUI showing provider/model/token usage live, with per-step spinners replacing the single global one.
- **Skill System** (#67) — Mercury can now load and route to user-defined skills. Skills are markdown-defined behaviors that get injected on demand based on keyword/semantic match.
- **Screenshot skill** — full website capture with viewport sizing and dark/light mode toggle.
- **Standalone binaries + one-line installers** (#61) — `mercury` now ships as a single executable for macOS (arm64/x64), Linux (x64/arm64), and Windows (x64). No Node install required. Per-OS docs and a hero install widget on the website.
- **Domain migration** — `mercury.cosmicstack.org` → `mercuryagent.sh`.
- **Chinese translations** for README, ARCHITECTURE, and CHANGELOG (#53).

### Fixed

- **Skill ambiguity prompt** (#68) — no more 10-skill fan-out on weak matches; users get a numbered picker when the router is uncertain.
- **Spurious ambiguity prompts on weak keyword overlap** — the matcher used to trigger the picker on incidental word overlap; now requires real signal.
- **Release asset names aligned with published binaries** (#63) — fixes installer scripts that were pointing at the wrong filenames.
- **Per-segment shell pattern checks** (#48) — the shell permission guard now validates each shell segment independently instead of trusting a single combined check.

### Maintenance

- **Removed `anonymous-file-uploader` skill** — no longer needed.
- **`pino` upgraded** 9.14.0 → ^10.3.1 (#51).
- Spinner polish and docs updates throughout.

### Migration from 1.1.9

No breaking changes. Skill system is opt-in (drop markdown files in `~/.mercury/skills/`). Token Saver Mode is off by default — enable it from the session menu or via config. Standalone binaries are an alternative install path; `npm i -g @cosmicstack/mercury-agent` keeps working exactly as before.

> Note: `1.1.10` was skipped to keep numbering aligned across publish channels.

## 1.1.5 — Smoother Onboarding

### Fixed: Onboarding no longer blocks users without Ollama

The onboarding flow had a critical UX problem: if a user didn't have Ollama running locally or an API key handy, they'd get stuck in infinite loops with no way to skip. This release makes onboarding smooth and forgiving.

**Key changes:**

1. **Ollama Local is now skippable** — If Ollama isn't running, you can skip it entirely or manually enter a model name. No more infinite retry loops.

2. **All provider setups allow skipping** — Every API key prompt now offers manual model name entry when the provider API is unreachable, and a clear skip option. The error messages changed from red (failure) to yellow (warning) to reduce frustration.

3. **"No provider" trap removed** — Previously, if you couldn't configure any provider, you were stuck in an infinite loop. Now you can type "skip" to save your config and return later with `mercury doctor`. A hint about DeepSeek's free API is shown.

4. **Ollama Local default model cleared** — The default was `gpt-oss:20b` (a non-standard model). Now defaults to empty, and the preferred model list uses common names like `llama3.2`, `mistral`, `phi3`, etc.

5. **Clearer first-run instructions** — The LLM Providers step now says "You can skip any provider by pressing Enter" and notes DeepSeek offers free keys.

### Summary of Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/index.ts` | `promptOllamaLocalModelSelection` — allow skipping base URL, manual model entry on fetch failure |
| `src/index.ts` | `promptApiKeyWithModelSelection` — manual model entry on API fetch failure, skip option |
| `src/index.ts` | `configure()` — "skip" option when no providers configured, hint about free keys |
| `src/utils/config.ts` | Ollama Local default model changed from `gpt-oss:20b` to empty string |
| `src/utils/provider-models.ts` | Ollama Local preferred models updated to common names |

## 1.1.4 — OpenAI Compilations & Provider Visibility

### New: OpenAI Compilations Provider

A new dedicated provider for **self-hosted, third-party, or any OpenAI-compatible API** — whether it's on your system, self-hosted, or a cloud service. The community asked for a way to connect to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint without it being tied to a specific vendor.

**Setup wizard flow:**
1. Enter server base URL (required) — e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1` or `https://my-llm.example.com/v1`
2. Optionally enter API key (press Enter to skip — local/self-hosted servers often don't need one)
3. Mercury tries to fetch models from `/models` endpoint
4. If successful — shows interactive model picker with option to enter a custom name
5. If fetch fails — prompts you to manually enter the model name
6. You can always type a custom model name before saving

**Key design points:**
- API key is **optional** — local and self-hosted servers often run without authentication
- Uses Chat Completions API (`/chat/completions`), not the Responses API (`/responses`)
- `isProviderConfigured` requires `baseUrl + model` but not `apiKey`
- No model name filtering — accepts all model IDs returned by the server
- Can be set as the default provider
- Environment variables: `OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_COMPAT_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL`, `OPENAI_COMPAT_ENABLED`

### New: Provider & Model Visibility at Session Start

The active provider and model are now prominently displayed when a session starts — a **magenta badge** (`⚡ Provider · Model`) makes it immediately obvious which LLM is being used. The full provider list is shown below with `← default` markers.

Before:
```
  Providers: DeepSeek, OpenAI
  Models: DeepSeek: deepseek-chat | OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini
```

After:
```
 ⚡ DeepSeek · deepseek-chat
  Providers: DeepSeek: deepseek-chat ← default  ·  OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini
```

### Fixes: `fetchOpenAICompatModels` optional API key handling

The internal `fetchOpenAICompatModels` function now only sends the `Authorization: Bearer` header when an API key is actually configured — previously it always sent the header (even with an empty key), which caused authentication errors on local servers that don't expect auth headers.

`OpenAICompatProvider` also now handles empty API keys gracefully by passing `'no-key'` as a fallback to `createOpenAI()`, preventing crashes on unauthenticated servers.

### Summary of Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/utils/config.ts` | Added `openaiCompat` to `ProviderName`, config interface, defaults, `isProviderConfigured()` |
| `src/providers/registry.ts` | Route `openaiCompat` → `OpenAICompatProvider` with `useChatApi: true` |
| `src/providers/openai-compat.ts` | Handle empty API key with `'no-key'` fallback for `createOpenAI()` |
| `src/utils/provider-models.ts` | `OPENAI_COMPAT_PREFERRED_MODELS`, optional auth headers in model fetch, no model filtering for `openaiCompat`, routing |
| `src/index.ts` | "OpenAI Compilations" in `PROVIDER_OPTIONS`, `promptOpenAICompatSetup()` with fetch→fallback flow, magenta default-provider badge at session start |
| `.env.example` | Added `OPENAI_COMPAT_*` env vars |
| `src/utils/provider-models.test.ts` | Added 2 tests for `openaiCompat` model catalog |

## 1.1.3 — Fix Ollama Cloud Provider

### What Happened

Ollama Cloud was completely broken — every request returned `404 Not Found`. Two independent bugs prevented `ollamaCloud` from functioning:

### Bug 1: Wrong SDK — Local Ollama API instead of OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions

`ollamaCloud` was routed through `OllamaProvider`, which uses the `ollama-ai-provider` package. This package is designed for **local** Ollama servers and targets `/api/chat` and `/api/tags` endpoints. Ollama Cloud exposes an **OpenAI-compatible** API at `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` — a completely different wire format.

- **Model listing** called `${baseUrl}/tags` → `https://ollama.com/api/tags` → 404
- **Chat completions** called `${baseUrl}/chat` → `https://ollama.com/api/chat` → 404

**Fix**: `ollamaCloud` is now routed through `OpenAICompatProvider` (using `createOpenAI()` from `@ai-sdk/openai`), matching the pattern used by all other OpenAI-compatible cloud providers (MiMo, Grok).

### Bug 2: Wrong default base URL

The default `OLLAMA_CLOUD_BASE_URL` was set to `https://ollama.com/api` — the local Ollama server path. The correct base URL for Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible API is `https://ollama.com/v1`.

**Fix**: Updated the default and added a config migration (`migrateLegacyOllamaCloudBaseUrl`) that automatically upgrades existing `mercury.yaml` files from `/api` to `/v1` on startup.

### Bug 3: Responses API instead of Chat Completions API

After fixing Bug 1, `OpenAICompatProvider` used `createOpenAI()()` which defaults to OpenAI's **Responses API** (`/responses`). Ollama Cloud only supports the **Chat Completions** API (`/chat/completions`), resulting in `https://ollama.com/api/responses` → 404.

**Fix**: Added `useChatApi` option to `OpenAICompatProvider`. When enabled (as it is for `ollamaCloud`), it calls `client.chat(model)` instead of `client(model)`, targeting `/chat/completions`.

### Bug 4: No baseUrl validation for ollamaCloud

`isProviderConfigured()` and `OllamaProvider.isAvailable()` only checked `apiKey.length > 0` for `ollamaCloud` — a missing or empty `baseUrl` would not be caught, causing a cryptic failure at request time.

**Fix**: Added explicit `ollamaCloud` branch in `isProviderConfigured()` and `isAvailable()` to validate both `apiKey` and `baseUrl`.

### Summary of Changes

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/providers/registry.ts` | Route `ollamaCloud` → `OpenAICompatProvider` with `useChatApi: true` |
| `src/providers/openai-compat.ts` | Add `useChatApi` option to use Chat Completions API |
| `src/utils/config.ts` | Default base URL `https://ollama.com/api` → `https://ollama.com/v1`; add `ollamaCloud` to `isProviderConfigured()`; add `migrateLegacyOllamaCloudBaseUrl()` |
| `src/utils/provider-models.ts` | New `fetchOllamaCloudModels()` using `/models` (OpenAI-compatible); rename `fetchOllamaModels` → `fetchOllamaLocalModels` (local `/tags` only); route `ollamaCloud` separately |
| `src/providers/ollama.ts` | `isAvailable()` also validates `baseUrl` for non-local providers |
| `.env.example` | `OLLAMA_CLOUD_BASE_URL` default updated to `https://ollama.com/v1` |
| `src/utils/provider-models.test.ts` | Added 2 tests for `ollamaCloud` model catalog |

## 1.1.2 — MiMo Provider & Budget Hardening

## 1.0.0 — Second Brain

This is a **major release** because it introduces the Second Brain — a persistent, structured memory system backed by SQLite with full-text search — alongside fundamental changes to how Mercury stores data and renders output.

### Why 1.0.0?

Mercury has been in rapid development through 0.x releases. The Second Brain feature represents a fundamental capability shift: Mercury now **remembers** across conversations, automatically extracting, consolidating, and recalling facts about you. Combined with the all-in-`~/.mercury/` data architecture and live CLI streaming, this marks a stable, production-ready foundation warranting a major version.

### Second Brain 🧠

- **10 memory types** — identity, preference, goal, project, habit, decision, constraint, relationship, episode, reflection
- **Automatic extraction** — after each conversation, Mercury extracts 0–3 facts with confidence, importance, and durability scores
- **Relevant recall** — before each message, injects top 5 matching memories within a 900-character budget
- **Auto-consolidation** — every 60 minutes, synthesizes a profile summary, active-state summary, and generates reflection memories from detected patterns
- **Conflict resolution** — opposing memories resolved by higher confidence or recency; negation detection handles "likes X" vs "does not like X"
- **Active → Durable promotion** — memories reinforced 3+ times automatically promote from short-lived `active` scope to long-lived `durable` scope
- **Auto-pruning** — active-scope memories stale after 21 days; inferred memories decay; low-confidence durable memories dismissed after 120 days
- **SQLite + FTS5** — full-text search for instant recall, all data stored locally at `~/.mercury/memory/second-brain/second-brain.db`
- **User controls** — `/memory` for overview, search, pause, resume, and clear in both CLI and Telegram

### CLI Streaming Restored

- **Live text streaming** — raw response tokens stream to the terminal as they arrive, then the full response is re-rendered with proper markdown formatting (headings in cyan with `■` markers, code blocks in yellow, lists with dim bullets, blockquotes with dim borders)
- **Cursor save/restore** — uses `\x1b7`/`\x1b8` ANSI sequences instead of fragile line counting, eliminating the duplicate-response bug for single-line answers
- **Tool feedback during streaming** — tool calls appear inline during streaming and are tracked for accurate output replacement

### Data Architecture: All in `~/.mercury/`

- **Before**: Memory (short-term, long-term, episodic) was stored relative to CWD at `./memory/`, creating files in random project directories
- **After**: All state now lives under `~/.mercury/` — config, soul, memory, permissions, skills, schedules, token tracking, daemon state
- **`getMemoryDir()`** helper returns `~/.mercury/memory/` — no more `memory.dir` config field
- **Auto-migration** — on first run, Mercury detects and moves any legacy `./memory/` directory to `~/.mercury/memory/`, then removes the old directory
- **Removed config fields**: `memory.dir`, `memory.secondBrain.dbPath` — these are now computed from `getMercuryHome()`

### Permission Modes

- **Ask Me** — confirm before file writes, shell commands that need approval, and scope changes (default on both CLI and Telegram)
- **Allow All** — auto-approve everything for the session (scopes, commands, loop continuation). Resets on restart.
- CLI: arrow-key menu at session start. Telegram: inline keyboard on first message, `/permissions` to change.

### Step-by-Step Tool Feedback

- **Numbered steps** — each tool call gets a step number (`1. read_file foo.ts`)
- **Spinner** — animated spinner with elapsed time while tools execute
- **Result summaries** — concise result shown after each step (e.g., `42 lines, 3 matches`)

### Other Changes

- **Improved markdown renderer** — cyan headings with `■` markers, yellow inline code, dim strikethrough, blue underlined links with dim URLs, bordered blockquotes, bordered tables
- **HTML entity decoding** — fixes double-encoding from marked's HTML output
- **Telegram organization access** — admins and members with approve/reject/promote/demote flows
- **Model selection during onboarding** — after validating an API key, Mercury fetches available models and lets you choose
- **Telegram editable status messages** — streaming updates use `editMessageText` for live response editing
- **Scheduled task notifications** — Mercury notifies the originating channel when a scheduled task runs
- **Full temporary scope for scheduled tasks** — tasks run in Allow All mode with auto-approved scopes

### Breaking Changes

- Memory data paths changed from `./memory/` to `~/.mercury/memory/` — auto-migration handles this
- Config field `memory.dir` removed — no action needed, value is ignored
- Config field `memory.secondBrain.dbPath` removed — path is now computed automatically
