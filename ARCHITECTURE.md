# Mercury — Architecture

> Living document. Updated as the system evolves.

## Overview

Mercury is a soul-driven, token-efficient AI agent that runs 24/7. It is an **orchestrator**, not just a chatbot. It can read/write files, run commands, and perform multi-step agentic workflows — all governed by a strict permission system. It communicates via channels (CLI, Telegram, future: Signal, Discord, Slack) and maintains persistent memory.

## Agentic Loop

Mercury uses the Vercel AI SDK's multi-step `generateText()` with tools:

```
User message → Agent loads system prompt (soul + guardrails + persona)
  → Agent calls generateText({ tools, maxSteps: 10 })
    → LLM decides: respond with text OR call a tool
      → If tool called:
        → Permission check (filesystem scope / shell blocklist)
        → If allowed: execute tool, return result to LLM
        → If denied: LLM gets denial message, adjusts approach
        → LLM continues (next step) — may call more tools or respond
      → If text: final response returned to user
  → Agent sends final response via channel
```

## Permission System

### Filesystem Permissions (folder-level scoping)

- Paths without scope = **no access**, must ask user
- User can grant: `y` (one-time), `always` (saves to manifest), `n` (deny)
- Manifest stored at `~/.mercury/permissions.yaml`
- Edit anytime — Mercury never bypasses

### Shell Permissions

- **Blocked** (never executed): `sudo *`, `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd if=`, fork bombs, `shutdown`, `reboot`
- **Auto-approved** (no prompt): `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, `git status/diff/log`, `node`, `npm run/test`
- **Needs approval**: `npm publish`, `git push`, `docker`, `rm -r`, `chmod`, piped `curl | sh`
- Commands restricted to CWD + approved folder scopes

### Inline Permission UX

When Mercury needs a scope it doesn't have:
```
  ⚠ Mercury needs write access to ~/projects/myapp. Allow? (y/n/always):
  > always
  [Scope saved to ~/.mercury/permissions.yaml]
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Permission Check |
|---|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read file contents | Read scope for path |
| `write_file` | Write to existing file | Write scope for path |
| `create_file` | Create new file + dirs | Write scope for parent dir |
| `list_dir` | List directory contents | Read scope for path |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file | Write scope, always confirms |
| `run_command` | Execute shell command | Blocklist + approval list + scope |
| `install_skill` | Install a skill from content or URL | No restriction |
| `list_skills` | List installed skills | No restriction |
| `use_skill` | Load and invoke a skill's instructions | No restriction |
| `schedule_task` | Schedule a recurring cron task | Validates cron expression |
| `list_scheduled_tasks` | List scheduled tasks | No restriction |
| `cancel_scheduled_task` | Cancel a scheduled task | No restriction |

## Agent Lifecycle

```
unborn → birthing → onboarding → idle ⇄ thinking → responding → idle
                                                          ↓
                                            idle → sleeping → awakening → idle
```

## Runtime Data Location

All runtime data lives in `~/.mercury/` (not the project directory):

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Config | `~/.mercury/mercury.yaml` |
| Soul files | `~/.mercury/soul/*.md` |
| Memory | `~/.mercury/memory/` |
| Skills | `~/.mercury/skills/` |
| Schedules | `~/.mercury/schedules.yaml` |
| Permissions | `~/.mercury/permissions.yaml` |

## Token Budget

- System prompt (soul + guardrails + persona): ~500 tokens per request
- Short-term context: last 10 messages
- Long-term facts: keyword-matched, ~3 facts injected
- Second brain: relevant user memories injected via `retrieveRelevant()` (~900 chars)
- Daily default: 1,000,000 tokens

## Second Brain

Mercury's second brain is an autonomous, persistent user model that learns from conversations over time. It is not a raw chat log and it is not a document dump. It stores compact, structured memories it believes may help in future conversations.

### How It Learns (Background, Invisible)

For each non-trivial conversation:
1. Mercury responds to the user normally.
2. After the response is sent, a background `extractMemory()` call extracts 0-3 typed memory candidates (preference, goal, project, etc.) using a separate LLM call (~800 tokens).
3. Each candidate goes through `UserMemoryStore.remember()` which:
   - Merges with existing memory if >= 74% overlap (strengthens evidence)
   - Auto-resolves conflicts (higher confidence wins, equal confidence → newer wins)
   - Auto-tiers: identity/preference → durable, goal/project → active
   - Promotes active → durable after 3+ reinforcing observations
   - Stores weak memories with low confidence — they decay naturally
4. On each heartbeat, Mercury consolidates (re-synthesizes profile/active summaries, generates reflections) and prunes (dismisses stale memories, promotes reinforced ones).

The user never sees or waits for this process. No tool calls are involved in the agentic loop.

### What It Does Not Store

- Greetings, small talk, filler
- Low-signal one-off details (below 0.55 confidence minimum)
- Speculative assistant guesses

### `/memory` Command

```
/memory        → Opens arrow-key menu (CLI) or sends overview (Telegram)

Menu:
  Overview          — total memories, breakdown by type, learning status
  Recent            — last 10 memories (type + summary + confidence)
  Search            — full-text search across all memories
  Pause Learning    — toggle: stop/resume storing new memories
  Clear All         — confirm, then wipes all memories
  Back
```

### User Controls

The second brain is autonomous in learning and management. The user's only controls are:
- **Pause/resume** learning (for sensitive conversations)
- **Clear all** memories (start fresh)
- **Observe** via overview, recent, and search

No review queue. No manual pinning. No manual conflict resolution. No manual editing.

## Channels

### CLI
- Readline-based with inline permission prompts
- `mercury start` or just `mercury`

### Telegram
- grammY framework + @grammyjs/stream for streaming
- Typing indicator while processing
- Proactive messages via heartbeat
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in .env or mercury.yaml

## Skills System

Mercury supports the Agent Skills specification. Skills are modular, installable instruction sets that extend Mercury's capabilities without code changes.

### Skill Format

Each skill is a directory under `~/.mercury/skills/` containing a `SKILL.md`:

```
~/.mercury/skills/
├── daily-digest/
│   └── SKILL.md       # Required: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
├── code-review/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── scripts/       # Optional: executable scripts
│   └── references/    # Optional: reference documents
└── _template/
    └── SKILL.md       # Seeded template for new skills
```

### SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: daily-digest
description: Send a daily summary of activity
version: 0.1.0
allowed-tools:
  - read_file
  - list_dir
  - run_command
---

# Daily Digest

Instructions for Mercury to follow when this skill is invoked...
```

### Progressive Disclosure

- **Startup**: Only skill names + descriptions are loaded (token-efficient)
- **Invocation**: Full skill instructions loaded on demand via `use_skill` tool
- This keeps the system prompt small while making skills available

### Skill Tools

- `install_skill`: Install from markdown content or URL
- `list_skills`: Show all installed skills
- `use_skill`: Load and invoke skill instructions into agent context

## Scheduler

Mercury can schedule recurring tasks using cron expressions. Tasks persist to `~/.mercury/schedules.yaml` and are restored on startup.

### Scheduled Task Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique task identifier |
| `cron` | Standard 5-field cron expression |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `prompt` | Text prompt to send to agent when task fires |
| `skill_name` | Optional: skill to invoke when task fires |
| `createdAt` | ISO timestamp |

### How Tasks Execute

When a scheduled task fires:
1. If `skill_name` is set, Mercury is prompted to invoke that skill via `use_skill`
2. If `prompt` is set, Mercury processes it as an internal (non-channel) message
3. Internal messages don't produce visible channel responses — they run silently in the agent loop

### Scheduler Tools

- `schedule_task`: Create a cron task with prompt or skill_name
- `list_scheduled_tasks`: Show all scheduled tasks
- `cancel_scheduled_task`: Remove a scheduled task

## Sub-Agents

Mercury supports sub-agents — independent worker processes that run in the same Node.js process as async coroutines. Sub-agents allow Mercury to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main agent.

### Why Sub-Agents?

- **Non-blocking**: The main agent stays available for new messages while sub-agents work
- **Resource-aware**: Max concurrent agents auto-detected from CPU cores and available RAM
- **Coordinated**: File locks prevent conflicting writes between agents
- **Controllable**: `/agents`, `/halt`, `/stop`, `/reset` commands for full user control
- **Non-blocking**: Sub-agents run in background — the main agent stays responsive to new messages
- **Visible**: Progress notifications (`🔄 Agent a1: Using: read_file`) and completion messages (`✅ Agent a1 completed (8.2s)`) are sent to the user's channel
- **Fast-path commands**: Slash commands like `/agents`, `/halt`, `/spotify`, `/code` are processed immediately even while the main agent is busy

### Architecture

```
User message → Main Agent → Decide:
  ├─ Quick response → Handle inline, respond directly
  └─ Heavy task → delegate_task tool → Spawn Sub-Agent (non-blocking)
       → Main Agent responds: "🤖 Agent a1 is working on..."
       → Main Agent stays available for next message
       → Sub-Agent progress: "🔄 Agent a1: Using: read_file, edit_file"
       → Sub-Agent completes: "✅ Agent a1 completed (8.2s): result..."
       → User can type /agents to check status at any time
```

### Component Overview

| Component | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| SubAgent | `src/core/sub-agent.ts` | Worker: isolated agentic loop with abort, file locks, progress |
| SubAgentSupervisor | `src/core/supervisor.ts` | Orchestrator: spawn/halt/queue, resource management |
| FileLockManager | `src/core/file-lock.ts` | Read/write locks: multiple readers, exclusive writer, auto-release |
| TaskBoard | `src/core/task-board.ts` | Shared state: task status, progress, persisted to disk |
| ResourceManager | `src/core/resource-manager.ts` | System detection: CPU cores, RAM, max concurrent formula |

### Resource Limits

Default max concurrent sub-agents = `clamp(1, cpus - 1, floor(availableRAM_GB / 2))`

Override via `/agents set max <n>` or `SUBAGENTS_MAX_CONCURRENT` env var.

### Lifecycle

```
unborn → birthing → onboarding → idle ⇄ thinking → responding → idle
                                                  ↓
                                          idle → delegating → idle
                                          idle → sleeping → awakening → idle
```

The `delegating` state covers when the main agent hands off a task to a sub-agent.

### Sub-Agent Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `delegate_task` | Delegate a task to a sub-agent worker |
| `list_agents` | List active sub-agents and their status |
| `stop_agent` | Stop a sub-agent (or all) |

### User Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/agents` | List all sub-agents (status, task, progress) |
| `/agents stop <id>` | Halt a specific sub-agent |
| `/agents stop all` | Halt all sub-agents |
| `/agents pause <id>` | Pause a sub-agent after current step |
| `/agents resume <id>` | Resume a paused sub-agent |
| `/agents config` | Show resource allocation |
| `/agents set max <n>` | Override max concurrent agents |
| `/halt` | Emergency stop all agents + clear queue |
| `/stop` | Stop all agents + clear queue + release locks + clear task board |
| `/reset` | Full reset: stop all + clear context (requires confirmation) |

### Programming Mode

Mercury has a built-in programming mode (activated via `/code plan`) that optimizes it for IDE-grade coding tasks. It operates in two states:

**Plan Mode** (`/code plan`): Mercury explores the codebase, analyzes problems, presents multiple approaches via `ask_user`, and outlines a step-by-step implementation plan — without writing code.

**Execute Mode** (`/code execute`): Mercury implements the approved plan step by step, running builds/tests after changes, committing at checkpoints, and delegating independent subtasks to sub-agents.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/code` | Show current programming mode status |
| `/code plan` | Switch to plan mode (analyze, present options, no coding) |
| `/code execute` | Switch to execute mode (implement plan step by step) |
| `/code off` | Exit programming mode |
| `/code toggle` | Cycle: off → plan → execute → off |

The `ask_user` tool enables Mercury to present choices (approaches, libraries, strategies) using arrow-key menus in CLI and inline keyboards in Telegram.

### File Lock Semantics

- **Read locks**: Multiple sub-agents can read the same file simultaneously
- **Write locks**: Exclusive — only one agent can write to a file at a time
- **Auto-release**: Locks are released when a sub-agent terminates ( completion, failure, or halt)
- **Deadlock detection**: Supervisor detects circular wait conditions between agents

### Task Board Persistence

All sub-agent task states are persisted to `~/.mercury/memory/task-board.json`, surviving process restarts.

### Config

```yaml
subagents:
  enabled: true        # Enable/disable sub-agent system
  maxConcurrent: 0      # 0 = auto-detect from CPU/RAM, >0 = manual override
  mode: auto            # auto = auto-detect, manual = use maxConcurrent value
```

Environment overrides: `SUBAGENTS_ENABLED`, `SUBAGENTS_MAX_CONCURRENT`, `SUBAGENTS_MODE`
## Spotify Integration

Mercury can control the user's Spotify playback remotely via the Spotify Web API. Music plays on the user's own devices (phone, web, desktop, TV, speakers) — not locally.

### Setup

1. Create a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Set the redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
3. Set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
4. Run `/spotify auth` in Mercury — this opens a browser for OAuth authorization
5. Tokens are stored in `~/.mercury/mercury.yaml` and auto-refreshed

### Device Selection

Spotify's device API lists all active devices the user is logged into. Mercury sends play/pause/skip commands to whichever device the user selects — it never plays audio locally.

### DJ Skill

The `spotify` skill (`/skills/spotify/SKILL.md`) activates DJ mode:
- Searches Spotify based on mood/genre/activity
- Presents choices via `ask_user` (arrow keys on CLI, inline buttons on Telegram)
- Manages playback, queues, likes, and playlists
- Creates curated playlists from user's taste

### Player UI

**CLI**: `/spotify player` opens an interactive arrow-key menu:
```
  ▶  Play / Resume
  ⏸  Pause
  ⏭  Next Track
  ⏮  Previous Track
  🔀 Toggle Shuffle
  🔁 Cycle Repeat
  🎵 Now Playing
  📱 Devices
  🔍 Search & Play
  🔊 Set Volume
  📋 Add to Queue
  ❤️  Like Current Track
  ✕  Exit Player
```

**Telegram**: Playback controls as inline keyboard buttons.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/spotify` | Show connection status |
| `/spotify auth` | Start OAuth flow (opens browser) |
| `/spotify player` | Interactive player (CLI only) |
| `/spotify devices` | List active Spotify devices |
| `/spotify device <id>` | Set active device |
| `/spotify now` | Show currently playing track |

### Config

```yaml
spotify:
  enabled: true
  clientId: ...
  clientSecret: ...
  redirectUri: http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
  accessToken: ...
  refreshToken: ...
  expiresAt: ...
  scopes: [...]
  deviceId: ...
```

Environment overrides: `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
